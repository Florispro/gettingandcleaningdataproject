ACTIVITY
	The type of activity performed by the subject wearing the smartphone
	Observations were made for the following activities:
	1. WALKING
	2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4. SITTING
	5. STANDING
	6. LAYING

SUBJECT
	The ID of the subject doing the activity.
	The experiment included 30 subjects. These subjects are numbered
	by ID's between 1 and 30.
	
DOMAIN
	The domain of the measured FUNCTION_VALUE. Possible values are:
	1. Time
	2. Frequency
	The original signals were measured in the time domain. An FFT transformation
	was applied to get data in the frequency domain.

SIGNAL_SOURCE
	The measured values were coming from either measurements on the body, or
	measurements on the gravity. So the possible values are:
	1. Body
	2. Gravity

MEASURED_QUANTITY
	Indicated the physical quantity being measured. Possible values are
	1. Acceleration
		The acceleration in the AXIS as measured by the accelerometer
	2. AccelerationJerk
		The time derivative of the acceleration measurement
	3. AccelerationMagnitude
		The magnitude of the acceleration, using the Euclidean norm
	4. AccelerationJerkMagnitude
		The magnitude of the jerk, using the Euclidean norm
	5. Gyro
		The angular velocitory in the AXIS as measured by the gyroscope
	6. GyroJerk
		The time derivative of the gyro measurement
	7. GyroMagnitude
		The magnitude of the angular velocity, using the Euclidean norm
	8. GyroJerkMagnitude
		The magnitude of the angular jerk, using the Euclidean norm		
		
MEASURED_FUNCTION
	The function which was measured in the observation. Possible values are:
	1. Mean
	2. StandardDeviation

AXIS
	The axis along which the measurement was taken. N.A. values indicate the
	measurement is not along an axis, but instead measures the magnitude.
	Possible values are:
	1. X
	2. Y
	3. Z
	4. N.A.

FUNCTION_VALUE
	The value of the measured function. It is an average per subject per 
	activity over all the observations recorded in the raw data.
